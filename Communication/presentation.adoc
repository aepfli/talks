[%step]
- isolated
- dictated

=== Documentation is the key!

[%step]
- write summaries
- seek and allow feedback

== Accessibility

[%notitle]
=== Documentation is the key, but

=== Everything should be accessible to everyone

[%step]
- .. to some degree
- needed for their work
- announced publicly

=== Message Control

[%step]
- Accessibility != Spammy
- define importance
- who can filter for others?


[NOTE.speaker]
--
- failing builds on feature branches, who cares
- failing buidls on integration branch, alert
- new fancy approach in use - interesting, but not worth to be alerted
- blocker on production system - alert everyone
--

=== Find the right tool!

- Blogs
- Chats
- Mail

== Take aways

- save
- trustful
- thrive for the best

=== Be the senior you needed when you were a junior!!!
