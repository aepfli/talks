# How to develop Softskills and work with a remote team [hard mode]

DISCLAIMER: This is an opinionated talk

As a developer i learned to develop my softskills the hard way. 
I made a lot of errors in this process. 
I will show off my biggest mistakes and provide some lessons learned. 
So other devs might think about their communication with others, and what they might want to improve.

## Background

My "career" (if you want to call it like that) started in a small team of 12 developers, with the first team split on the horizon and a soon to be added remote team in a different country. 
Based on that a lot of in-place communication patterns will have been proven as inefficient or simply incompatible with said remote team. 
It took some time, but lets start with each lesson one by one or shall we call it escalations, because those had some serious impact, and not the easy kind.

We will talk about:
- Punctuation
- Inclusion
- Transparency
- Reproducibility and Accessibility
- Message flow or control
- Define decision making processes


## Lesson How? aka Punctuation is the key

Somehow during my teenage years i develop a strange habbit of ending each sentence with an Exclamationmark. I am not sure, but i might thought it looked cool. Nevertheless i did not pay much attention to that fact, till the first pull requests from said remote team were created. Oh boy, looking back some of those comments seem to me now really rude, but it never was my intention. Here are some examples:

"You should extract that into an own Method!"
"This looks odd! Somehow it feels off, i think you should rework that!"
"can you clean this!"

There is even something else odd with this, but that is another lesson. Lets focus on this Exclamationmark, it is horrific. Think about it, a "Stranger" somewhere else, you hardly know, writes that. Quiet intrusive.

Keep in mind, that does not only affect your PR-comments. This is also the key for a lot of other communications like email, slack, etc. As soon as you lose the direct contact to the other person, and can not undermine your text with body language, it gets really hard to guess your intention.

## Lesson Inclusion 

Lets take a Look at the last examples:

"You should extract that into an own Method!"
"This looks odd! Somehow it feels off, i think you should rework that!"
"can you clean this!"

Those are all direct inflicting a person, it is me pointing at them. But in the end, we are working together on a solution. 
Just changing this simple finger pointing to an all inclusive "We" those comments do not look like the same:

"We should extract that into an own Method"
"This looks odd, Somehow it feels off, i think we should rework that"
"can we clean this"

Feels like i went from full beast into kitty cat

So after a some time, i or better my scrum master figured that out and trained me, to use proper punctuation. 
Additionally i started rereading my comments before posting them. 
It helped i was not the mean grumpy dude in the other country complaining, i was the nice co worker who tried to find a common solution. 

But that is not all, there is even the other part, of where you communication, and who has access to it.

## Lesson Transparency

Yeah well, as you can imagine, this was not my last trip down the escaltion hill. 

Next issue descision finding and transport of such. Our co located teams had developed a really nice communication strategy - we called it the "flurfunk" - actually decision were transported over a coffee or shouted into the next office. No need for writing things down, or explain it in detail somewhere. Everybody was there, everybody heard it, we are fine... NOT. The remote team started to feel isolated, it was hard for them to figure out what was going on, what have been the recent decisions, etc. They were just not in the loop. To uncover such an issue is not that trivial. The party who should change has no pain, for us it was no problem, we got all we need. Our remote team needed us to change, or adapt the process, without being involved in the process. Tough nut - but luckily we managed to get a hold of this somehow. It took us quiet a while, but after defining some crucial "communication guidelines", which involved emails and async communication, we managed to get to a good and transparent point.

So transparency is the key.

## Lesson Accessibility and Reproducibility

Another big part in our defined guidelines was accessibility of Information and this goes hand in hand with the Transparency part. Being transparent is one side, but all the information should also be accessible for everyone.

Let's say we have an important meeting regarding some design decisions. What is the normal process. The most experienced devs or architects stick their heads together (ideally this meeting is publicly known, so people at least know what is going on) and decide on a fancy new techstack every one should follows. But why? How did you decide on that? Of course you should not write down every comment in the meeting, but an overview. Not everyone had time to join, not everyone was invited. In the end everyone should not why and where to find this information. You never know when aliens will obduct your smart senior devs, or when they forget about those things.

## Lesson Message Filtering
Let's get controversial.

Every developer wants to be informed about important issues which affect his/her business and of course there need to be some kind of Message control or disciplin. But not filtering, i have seen this quiet often, best example is "blockers" (we all love them). So Quality engineer A gets a blocker ticket, and starts finding help from developers. Pinging random senior devs with the same question - ticket was announced in the right communication channels anyways. But for A it is going to slow. So lets ping the senior devs. They should know what is going on - but instead of some common ground, this will most likely happen in a hidden place, like a direct message. Suddenly A has 3 devs responding in hidden communication channels, none synced with the others, a lot of information gathered. But even filtered for the 3 responding devs. Instead of sharing a channel - no not a group dm, a channel - a lot of duplicate information and efforts could be reduced. Even worse when Developer 4 who is actually working on the task, tries to gather information. Developer 4 does not know, who provided information, nor who said what. It is a big black box.

Let's say we had a channel, suddenly 4 people would talk together about the issue, pointing out flaws and number 4 would have the whole history of communication if needed.

## Decision making

Well a lot of people feel left out, when they do not have the possibility to give some kind of feedback on topics, or at least issue their concerns. I am not talking about Business decisions, but even decisions regarding codestyle or basic implementation patterns, should be discussed on a broader stage, like a ratifcation process.

It is quiet easy that people feel left out, and there is always a good chance that there are concerns regarding a decision you might miss. So instead of doing decisions in a big round, split them up - use small groups as representatives, but do not give them the power to immediately take a decisions. Those representatives should introduce to their nominators, what they have been talking about, and what they want to propose - and most importantly what are the reasons, for the proposal. Only after this ratification - i would see it as decided.

Yes it will take time, but it is important to at least give everyone affected the possibility to react and issue concerns - even if somebody is not issueing their concerns when they had the time, they had the possibility. This will give people a feeling of inclusion, and possibility to change.
