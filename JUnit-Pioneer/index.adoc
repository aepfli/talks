=== Idea of JUnit-Pioneer

image::background/basic.jpg[background, size=cover]

> JUnit Pioneer provides extensions for JUnit 5 and its Jupiter API. It does not limit itself to proven ideas with wide application but is purposely open to experiments. It aims to spin off successful and cohesive portions into sibling projects or back into the JUnit 5 code base.

=== Current Status

* Hobby Project by Hobbyists
* 5 Maintainers/Hobbyists
* ~ regular Meetings
* GitHub Actions as CI/CD tool

=== Project Overview

* JUnit5 Extension Collection
* JUnit5 Standalone Extension
* JUnit4 to JUnit5 Migration Tool

=== Development

* Burst mode -> No Auto-releasing
* Regular on Stream coordination
* Focused on Collection

=== Improved Build Experience

image::CurrentBuild.png[]

[%step]
* first stage for security
* second stage for immediate feedback
* third stage for compatibility
** 3 OS, 3 Java Versions, multiple JUnit versions
* fourth stage experimental builds, releasing, etc

[.chapter]
== Development Experience

image::background/caveats.jpg[background, size=cover]

=== Ideal Workflow

[%step]
* Interuption free workflow 
* were all information and possible actions are presented
* where they are needed,
* with little effort to access them
* for people working on the project

=== CI Failure

image::ci_fialure.png[]

[%step]
* Why?
* Build are just called "Main build/ with ..."
* no intermediate information to contributors and reviewers

=== CI Failure - Overview

[%step]
* Split up into smaller builds: Tests, Codestyles
* Use Test Reporters to comment on Pull Requests with test information
** https://github.com/marketplace/actions/junit-report-action[JUnit Report Action]
** https://github.com/marketplace/actions/test-reporter[Test Reporter]
** https://github.com/marketplace?category=&query=junit+sort%3Apopularity-desc&type=&verification=[...]

=== CI Failure - Code Formatting

image::spotless-comments.jpg[]

=== CI Failure - Code Formatting

[%step]
* provide IDE configurations
* extract to own job to increase visibility
* Git-Hooks ~

=== Actions

* Aim to increase information within Pull Requests, without getting Spammy
* Improve correlation between expecations and tooling

[.chapter]
== Maintainer Experience

image::background/LegoKeyboard.jpg[background, size=cover]

=== Low hanging fruits

[%step]
* Templates
* MD-Update
** Security
** Code of Conduct
* CLA-Bot

=== Dependency Management

* Dependabot discarded
* Renovate evaluation

=== Result

* Focus on the Contributions

[.chapter]
== Standalone Extension(s)

image::background/starwars.jpg[background, size=cover]

=== Definition

> A standalone extension or extension collection is fullfilling a dedicated purpose.
If the goal is a general purpose extension collection as an incubator, it should be part of
the main project.

=== Problems

* not a lot of attention
* build and setup outdated

=== Possible Solution

[%step]
* Centralize CI configuration
* Unify and optimize build
* Extract configuration to a common point

=== Open/Close Principle

[%step]
* Provide a Standard with little configuration
* Allow customization to match project needs
* Able to define their own mode of operation
* Allows exploration and continous improvements

=== Investigations

[%step]
* Versioning of unified resources
* Feasibility

=== Playground Project

[%step]
* Testing integrations
* Verifying adaptions
* Template for other extensions

[.chapter]
== Growth Basics

image::background/architecture.jpg[background, size=cover]

=== How to tackle this?

[%step]
* There are already a lot of big projects
* No need to reinvent
* Take a look and inspect others, maybe ask what is not working

=== Without Research (In my Mind) - Assumptions

[%step]
* JUnit Pioneer will be a collection of small projects
* Not all Maintainers will work, and want to work on other extensions
* A basic ruleset/tooling should be in place

[.chapter]
== Growth
 
image::background/advanced.jpg[background, size=cover]

=== Project types

* Extensions/Projects
* Tooling
* Governance

=== Project types - Tooling/Governance

> All projects with the purpose of supporting the contributors.

[%step]
* GitHub Actions collection (if that is possible)
  ** Build Actions
  ** Linters, Formatters, ...
* Maybe centralized build tools (unified Gradle configuration etc.)

[.chapter]
== Governance

image::background/advanced.jpg[background, size=cover]

=== Goal

Communication should be accessible, transparent and inclusive.

=== Governance Project

> General overview of the organization governance and setup

[%step]
* Membership types
* Basic rule set
* Code of conduct, ...
* What happens when

=== "Architectural Decision Records"

[%step]
* ... to persist decisions and revisit them.
* Each decision should be persisted in a record
** New sub projects with maintainer and purpose
** Change in processes
* Why not Issues?

=== Issues

[%step]
* Noisy
* Hard to Follow
* Good starting point
* How to handle updates?

=== Membership Types

[%step]
* Contributor
* Member of Extension
* Maintainer of Extension
* Member of Organization
* Maintainer of Organization

=== Membership Topics

* Election
* Security
* Permissions

=== Membership Permissions

* *Member of Extension* can be part of one or more Extensions and is "approved" "Approver"
* *Maintainer of Extension* can be part of one or more Extensions and are allowed to Merge/Release etc.
* *Maintainer of Extension* is also *Member of Organization*
* *Member of Organization* is "approved" "Approver" on Tooling/Governance projects
* *Maintainer of Organization* is the highest level. They have access to secrets etc. and full rights

=== Membership Election

[%step]
* How to get elected? (Nomination by others within Role)
** Veto by *Maintainer of Organization* (Yes)
* Development Contribution needed? (No)
** Can somebody be elected due to financial support? eg Corporate buying in? (No)
* How many people have to approve which are already part of that role? (?)
** Will it be an asynchronous process with a deadline? or a meeting where only appearence counts? (?)
* What about demoting? reasons, secret rotation, etc?

[.chapter]
== Actions

[%notitle]
=== Actions I
[%step]
* Update ReadMes (Security, Code of Conduct)
* Add Templates
* Improve GHA Feedback for Unittests
* Extract Spotless into own Build Job

[%notitle]
=== Actions II
[%step]
* Evaluate GitHook for Spotless
* Provide IDE support
* Evaluate Feasibility of Template Repository (GHA, Build Config, etc)
* Evaluate need of a Governance project

=== Time Investment

* 2h thinking in hot humid conditions
* 2h thinking during runs
* 1h scimming GitHubs Most Used Actions/Apps for Inspiration
* 1h of exploration (renovate, CLA-Bot, GHA external workflows)
* 3h presentation/training (still not happy with it)
* 1h of investigation (looking around what others do)
